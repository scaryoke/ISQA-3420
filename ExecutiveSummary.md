# ISQA-3420: Executive Summary

##The Problem: 
Developers are using and bringing in code or other resources from outside of the company.They are using open source repositories and other methods.  If left unchecked, this could open us up to licensing issues and several vulnerablity issues.  This use of open source code is common to the IT world, but there are several consequences our organization needs to be prepared to deal with. It is important that we address these issues before we have a problem like Ameriprise did in 2014.  Ameriprise was using software inconjunction with a third-party and unbeknown to them it violated the terms of the license.  This violation of licensing resulted in an unwanted lawsuit for the company (opensource).


##The Solution:
Our solution to this problem, is to allow the developers to use open-source software.  In order to make sure we are compliant with all licenses and vulnerability we will implemnet some new policies.  The fist is once the code is ready to be used by the developer it will need to be sent to FOSSology that will scan the licenses associated with the files being used from Open Source Communities.  This will check the code for all known licenses.  We can then determine if these licenses are something we as a company are able to work with, or if we will need to find something else.  From there, we will then send the file/package to the National Vulnerability Database.  This we determine any and all known vulnerabilities for this code.  We can then determine if these vulnerabilities meet our expectations or if we will need to fix them in order to use them.
