# ISQA-3420: Executive Summary
This is the executive summary for the group project.
The Problem:
Devlopers are using and bringing in code or other resources from outside of the company.  They are using open source repositories and other methods.  If left unchecked, this could open us up to licensing issues and a whole bunch of vulnerablity issues.  It is important that we address these issues before we have a problem like Ameriprise did in 2014.  Ameriprise was using software inconjunction with a third-party and unbeknown to them it violated the terms of the license.  This then resulted in a bunch of lawsuits. (opensource)
